# UI Test Plan

The test-ui skill gives each test case isolated storage. Every session ends
with `bye` so the application exits cleanly.

## Test case 1: Add a todo

- Aim: Verify that a todo is added.

### Inputs

```text
todo borrow book
bye
```

### Expected output

```text
Got it. I've added this task:
  [T][ ] borrow book
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
```

## Test case 2: Add a typed deadline

### Inputs

```text
deadline submit report /by 2019-12-02 1800
bye
```

### Expected output

```text
Got it. I've added this task:
  [D][ ] submit report (by: Dec 02 2019, 6:00 PM)
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
```

## Test case 3: Add a same-day event

- Aim: Verify the `/on` shorthand and time-only endpoints.

### Inputs

```text
event meeting /on 2/12/2019 /from 1400 /to 1600
bye
```

### Expected output

```text
Got it. I've added this task:

Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
```

## Test case 4: Add a multi-day event

An event's end must be strictly after its start.
```

## Test case 7: Persist typed tasks

- Aim: Verify ISO persistence across an application restart.

### Inputs (session 1)

```text

deadline /by 2019-12-02 1800
deadline submit report /by
bye
```

### Expected output

```text
A deadline needs "/by" followed by its date and time. Try: deadline submit report /by 2019-12-02 1800

mark 1
unmark 1
delete 1
list
bye
```

Nice! I've marked this task as done:
[T][X] read book

### Inputs

```text
mark
mark abc
mark 0
delete 999999999999999999999999999999999999
bye
```

```text
Enter the task number to mark. Try: mark 1
"abc" is not a valid task number. Enter a positive whole number.
Task numbers start from 1. Use "list" to see the available task numbers.
The task number "999999999999999999999999999999999999" is too large. Use "list" to see the available task numbers.
```

- Aim: Verify that empty and out-of-range task lists are distinguished.

### Inputs

```text
delete 1
todo first task

Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
Task 2 does not exist. Choose a number from 1 to 1, or use "list" to view your tasks.
```

## Test case 17: Reject unknown and empty commands

- Aim: Verify that parsing passes the actual command name into localized errors.

### Inputs

```text
remember borrow book

bye
```

### Expected output

```text
"remember" is not a recognized command. Available commands: todo, deadline, event, list, mark, unmark, delete, bye.
You didn't enter a command. Try "list" to view your tasks.
```

## Test case 18: Keep list without a date compatible

- Aim: Verify that `list` without a date still shows every task.

### Inputs

```text
todo borrow book
list
bye
```

### Expected output
